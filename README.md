# Introduction to Quantum Computing using the QISKit SDK

This repository is intended to accompany and facilitate my proposed talk on Introduction to Quantum Computing using the QISKit SDK for PyCon India 2018. As the content for the talk matures and approaches finalization, I'll update this repository with links and content. 

The most relevant section of the repo is the [Topics Covered](#topics-covered) section which currently outlines the tentative content of the workshop and will be updated as the idea matures to include further details and content links.

The Issue Tracker for this repo is also a great place to reach out to me with queries and suggestions regarding the talk (since I'll be a lot more active on GitHub than on the PyCon website).

## Description
This talk intends to provide a fairly gentle introduction to the fundamental ideas behind quantum computing and the concepts of quantum physics that allow quantum computing to surpass the limits of classical computing. We then proceed to a quick demo of using the QISKit Python SDK provided by the IBM Q team to run experiments on a simulated (or real) quantum computer.

## Topics Covered 
Some of the things we'll (tentatively) be looking at during the talk are:

* Quantum superposition (explained using the Schrodingers Cat, of course)
* What is a qubit?
* How is a quantum computer more capable than a classical one?
* Quantum logic gates and the Hadamard gate in particular
* IBM Q, and a quick look at their GUI
* Using IBM Q's QISKit Python SDK to run quantum experiments

Please note that this list is tentative and I'll appreciate suggestions to improve the talk.

## Prerequisites
This talk touches upon a topic that doesn't have any hard and fast prerequisites (apart from Python syntax, of course), but basic knowledge of the following topics will make things easier to grasp during the talk and later down the line:

* Some idea of what quantum physics is
* The concept of a quantum superposition of states
* Familiarity with linear algebra (not really for the talk, but will help later down the line)

## Speaker Info
I'm a full-stack JS developer, Python enthusiast and Rust lover who revels in learning new technologies. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and the company of witty people.
